      <p>
        Always thought, this would be so great as a floor-tile in my bathroom{" "}
        <br />
        Here you are now, have a look at some artworks from different artist
        picked by your host!
        <br />
        Hope you'll enjoy them and who knows, end up with remodeling you're
        whole flat... <br />
        OR at least have a different view on some worth knowing artists ;-)
